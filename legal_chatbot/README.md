# Legal Document Chatbot (Local Flask App)

## Overview
This project is a local, offline-capable Flask chatbot that guides a user through drafting 8 types of legal documents (Will, FIR, RTI, Affidavit, Legal Notice, Grievance Letter, Business License Application, Legal Letter). It follows a conversational interview flow (greeting -> choose document -> ask fields one-by-one -> generate preview -> downloadable PDF).
